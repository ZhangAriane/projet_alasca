This package provides a first DEVS simulation example using the event scheduling
world view proper to discrete event simulations developed in simulation
languages like Simscript for more than 50 years. The example is very standard:
a single server with one waiting line. As usual in this type of simulations,
stochastic processes are instrumental in the model. Clients arrive at the bank
following an exponential inter-arrival delay, while service time by the server
also follows an exponential duration.
</p>
<p>
To show the modularity of DEVS simulation models, the organisation of the models
in this example is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>ClientGenerator</code> model exports client arrival events that
  it generates at time instant computed from exponential delays obtained
  through a random number generator.</li>
<li>A <code>BankModel</code> implements the simulated behaviour of the
  server <i>i.e.</i>, clients are put into a waiting queue and start service
  events take the first client in the queue, put the server into an
  occupied state and plan the end of service event for the client. At the
  end of service, the next client in the queue can start its service or, if the
  queue is empty, the server is put into a free state.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Events in DEVS are represented by objects, instances of the following classes:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Arrival</code>: the arrival of a client, exported by
  <code>ClientGenerator</code> and imported by <code>BankModel</code>.</li>
<li><code>StartService</code>: beginning of service for a client, internal
  to <code>BankModel</code>.</li>
<li><code>EndService</code>: the end of service of a client, also internal to
  <code>BankModel</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The class <code>Client</code> represents a client in the simulation and is used
to keep information about the client (its time of arrival) to be able to
compute statistics about the simulation run (average time passed by clients
at the bank <i>i.e.</i>, the time between their arrival and the end of their
service). Statistics about the run are returned through the model simulation
reports represented by the classes <code>ClientGeneratorReport</code> (number
of generated client arrivals) and <code>BankModelReport</code> (mean time
passed by clients in the system). As a good practice for simulation reports,
the run parameters (mean inter-arrival time and mean service time) are recalled
in the reports.
</p>
<p>
Usually, in simulation several runs are made to gather more precise statistics.
To show how to parameterise simulation models, the mean inter-arrival time and
the mean service time are made run parameters for <code>ClientGenerator</code>
and <code>BankModel</code> respectively. Run parameters are put into a map from
parameter names to values in the launcher classes (<code>SimulationMain</code>
and <code>RTSimulationMain</code>) and then passed to the models by calling the
method <code>setSimulationRunParameters</code> before starting the run.
Observe the way names of run parameters are defined as public constants in
model classes and used in the launcher classes. Each model class then redefines
<code>setSimulationRunParameters</code> to get the values of their run
parameters.
</p>
<p>
Both launcher classes use simulation architecture descriptions to define the
organisation of models and simulation engines and then instantiate this
architecture with objects by calling <code>constructSimulator</code> on the
architecture description. Architecture descriptions are a kind of DSL
(domain-specific language), but at this time this language does not have a
surface syntax but is only defined by Java classes corresponding to an abstract
syntax tree. <code>constructSimulator</code> generates model and simulation
engine instances from this abstract syntax tree, verifying construction
constraints and automatically making the necessary connections between them,
hence avoiding a cumbersome manual instantiation process and inevitable
mistakes that this would generate.
</p>
<p>
<code>SimulationMain</code> shows how to build a simulation architecture,
instantiate and run it in a simulation using a global logical time that steps
from one event to the next and thus allowing to execute simulation runs as fast
as events can be executed on the models. <code>RTSimulationMain</code> shows
how to do that in a global real time synchronised upon the computer clock.
As running simulations in exact real time can take very long (here, it would
mean hours, days and months if the event execution followed exactly real
life delays between client arrivals and real life service durations). In this
implementation of DEVS, it is possible to execute "real time" simulations in
an <i>accelerated</i> time line (isomorphic to real time but several time
faster - or slower in fact). This capability is not exploited in this example
(it is in other examples), so times and delays used in this example are not
realistic but chosen to make the runs not last too long.
