This package provides a first DEVS simulation example with HIOA models using
value histories and inter/extrapolation for the evaluation of model variables
at time instants that do not correspond with evaluation time instants.
</p>
<p>
The organisation of the models are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a model instance of <code>TicModel</code> emits events of type
  <code>TicEvent</code> at a chosen rate (see the run parameters) towards
  another model instance of <code>HIOA_Generator</code>;</li>
<li>the model instance of <code>HIOA_Generator</code> reacts to the reception of
  a <code>TicEvent</code> (external transition) by triggering an immediate
  internal transition which increments an exported variable by 1;</li>
<li>the model variable <code>generated</code> of the <code>HIOA_Generator</code>
  is imported as a model variable <code>other</code> by a model instance of
  <code>HIOA_Multiplier</code> which is triggered at another chosen rate
  (see again the run parameters) to compute another model variable
  <code>mine</code> which value is obtained by multiplying the value
  of the variable <code>other</code> by a factor that is also chosen;</li>
<li>finally, a third model instance of <code>HIOA_Consumer</code> imports
  the variable <code>mine</code> of <code>HIOA_Multiplier</code> as its own
  variable <code>otherCurrent</code> and is also triggered at a chosen rate
  (see again the run parameters) to set the value of its internal model
  variable <code>myCurrent</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This example shows how to use the fix point initialisation protocol for HIOA
models as dependencies exist between models variables. It also shows how to use
and the potential impact of value histories and inter/extrapolation. To see
the difference, a command line argument controls whether the run uses
inter/extrapolation or not. In fact, the class <code>SimulationMain</code> has
two command line arguments: the first tells whether the run is in real time or
not, the second  whether it uses inter/extrapolation or not. The javadoc of
<code>SimulationMain</code> gives the results that must be obtained in the two
cases.
