/**
 * The interface <code>IncrementalInterpolatorGeneratorI</code> defines the
 * methods offered by a generator of interpolation functions for functions
 * defined over points that can be incrementally extended by progressively
 * adding new points at the end of the current domain.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An incremental interpolator is very well suited to get a continuous
 * function definition for functions that are defined over points that
 * are progressively computed (for example, in numerical integration
 * algorithms) or acquired (from experimental measures).
