/**
 * The class <code>EventComparator</code> implements a comparison between
 * events used to define a total order of execution among events.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An event e1 is earlier than an event e2 if its time of occurrence is
 * earlier than the time of occurrence of e2. If the two events occur at
 * the same time, e1 is earlier than e2 if it has priority over e2 (method
 * <code>hasPriorityOver</code> of <code>EventI</code>). If no priority is
 * defined among events, the latest to be inserted will appear after the
 * earlier ones in the queue.
 * </p>
