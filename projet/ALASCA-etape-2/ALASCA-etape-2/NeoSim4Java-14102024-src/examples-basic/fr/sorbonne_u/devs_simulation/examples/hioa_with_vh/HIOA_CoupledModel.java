 * The class <code>HIOA_CoupledModel</code> defines a coupled model for
 * the HIOA with value history example.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This coupled model class is not really necessary. Usually, if the coupled
 * model uses a standard simulation report (collecting the reports of its
 * submodels) then the class {@code CoupledModel} can be directly used.
 * A new class is needed mainly to define a specific simulation report.
